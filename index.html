        <p>“Stop. Take a deep breath. And walk, fly or catch a train away from the city and into a world where the average pace of life is slower than slow. “It is not down in any map; true places never are.” Herman Melville.</p>
        <p>India has something to offer to all kinds of tourists. Be it an adventure enthusiast, a foodie, a pilgrim or so on, everyone gets an apt destination to enjoy the vacation here.

        <p>f we are to safeguard the natural systems that sustain all life on Earth, we need a strategy to guide biodiversity conservation. In 2019, the Global Deal for Nature highlighted the need for at least 30% of terrestrial and marine areas to be protected if we are to conserve the planet’s biodiversity, secure essential ecosystem services and prevent the catastrophic consequences of a changing climate. This is a remarkable vision, and the strategies towards achieving this will vary across the world. In Africa a pragmatic roadmap to achieve this vision is needed. </p>

    <P id="alu">During 2020, African Parks conducted an internal analysis of the protected area network in Africa, utilising data layers and our collective expertise of the various regions in Africa. Considering a number of key elements including landscape size and potential, strength of legislation and ecosystem health and threats, we identified 161 “anchor areas”. These are areas which have the greatest chance of being large functioning <strong>landscapes that harbour globally significant</strong> biodiversity to provide invaluable ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, clean air and fresh water, while contributing to stability, food security and socio-economic benefits for millions of people.For the purpose of the analysis, we focused on areas of large scale that are still relatively ecologically intact. This does not imply that smaller areas do not play a valuable role – they are important for the conservation of individual species, as well as for cultural and tourism reasons. <span>new line</span>
